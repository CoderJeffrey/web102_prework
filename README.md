## Notes

Overall, the prework instructions are quite educational and useful, and they lead me to the conclusion of the problem ðŸŽ‰   
The most difficult element is attempting to include the Game tag in the navigation bar so that the user can quickly navigate to the game section. To begin, I must become acquainted with page layout, HTML, and Flexbox in order to create a stunning tag. Another aspect is to debug through the challenge; there are many areas where I need to figure out how to employ complicated Javascript usage to create the page's multi-functionality.

However, after conquering all of these obstacles, I learned a lot about JS, HTML, and CSS, as well as the basic fundamentals of front-end/back-end development. I am grateful for accepting this challenge and want to learn more in the web102 courses if accepted.
